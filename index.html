<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p> I am currently a sophomore at the University of Texas studying marketing and entrepreneurship. I hope that one day I can combine all my interests and passions and monetize them in the form of a creative/marketing consulting firm. With my resource and knowledge I plan on giving it to those who seek it and without me wouldn't be able to attain it. I've also met obama.   <br /><br /></p>
